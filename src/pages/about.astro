        Dead Man's Brew is a personal collection of movie tickets, documenting
        years of cinema experiences and theatrical visits.
      </p>
      <p>
        This collection represents more than just ticket stubs - it's a journey
        through different theaters, movie ratings, and the evolution of cinema
        pricing over time.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl mt-8 mb-4">The Collection</h2>
      <p>
        Each ticket tells a story of a moment in time, from the early days at
        Carmike Royal Cinema 10 to recent visits at Marquette Cinemas. The
        collection spans multiple years and showcases the diversity of film
        experiences.
